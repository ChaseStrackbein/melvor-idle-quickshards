### Userscript
[Get the userscript](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/428146-quickshards-for-melvor-idle) *(incompatible with Greasemonkey)*

## Usage
The quantity represents how many of the currently opened recipe you would like to buy. For example, a recipe that requires 6 red summoning shards will result in the following:
* x1 = 6 shards
* x10 = 60 shards

If you already owned an amount of the required shards, that will be deducted from the total shard purchase, for example if you had 4 red summoning shards in the bank with the previous example:
* x1 = 2 shards
* x10 = 56 shards
